Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.

It is also the most popular Open Source and free, as in
freedom, operating system.

It powers the vast majority of the servers that
compose the Internet. It's the base upon which
everything is built upon. But not just that. Android is
based on (a modified version of) Linux.

The Linux "core" (called kernel) was born in 1991 in
Finland, and it went a really long way from its humble
beginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the GNU
Operating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.

There's one thing about Linux that corporations like
Microsoft and Apple, or Google, will never be able to
offer: the freedom to do whatever you want with your
computer.

They're actually going in the opposite direction,
building walled gardens, especially on the mobile side.

Linux is the ultimate freedom.

It is developed by volunteers, some paid by
companies that rely on it, some independently, but
there's no single commercial company that can dictate
what goes into Linux, or the project priorities.
